                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Job Application</h2>
                <p class="center">A job application form is an official form given to candidates by the employer asking
                    a wide range of questions about the individual and their skills related to the job. Forms are
                    legally defensible and stand as a way for candidates to introduce themselves to employers.
                    Businesses use these forms to find those best suited for open positions, sending a select few to the
                    next phase of the process. </p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Resume information</h2>
                <p class="center">Resumes tell the employer about your experiences, skills and work history. Use your
                    resume to highlight items that indicate you are a good worker, are qualified for the position and
                    bring desirable skills to the job. If you are a student and have little or no previous job
                    experiences, enhance information about your school and community activities.

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Resume Generate</h2>
                <p class="center">A resume is a document commonly used in the hiring process. It includes information
                    about your background and qualifications and should communicate the most important, relevant
                    information about you to employers in a clear, easy-to-read format. The goal is to quickly
                    communicate why you are uniquely qualified for the position based on your skills and experiences.
